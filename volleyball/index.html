	 The first person to introduce me to volleyball was my uncle. 
	  <ul>
		  I joined my first volleyball team in 2016.
		  I found that I really loved volleyball and that it was really fun.
		  I then kept joining teams year after year at the rec center near my house.
		  I then decided to join a club team which was really fun.
