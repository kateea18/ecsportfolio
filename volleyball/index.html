	 The first person to introduce me to volleyball was my uncle. My entire family has or is still playing volleyball which is really fun. A lot of my cousins play which is a really fun activity to play at family gatherings. So volleyball to me is a fun thing for me to play and is also a way to connect with my family.

		  <li>I found that I really loved volleyball and that it was really fun.</li>
		  <li>I then kept joining teams year after year at the rec center near my house.</li>
		  <li>I then decided to join a club team which was really fun.</li>
